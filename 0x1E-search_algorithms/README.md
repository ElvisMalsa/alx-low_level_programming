# <p align="center">C - Search Algorithms</p>

> Search algorithms are techniques used to find the presence or location of an element in a collection of data. These algorithms are widely used in computer science and information retrieval for various applications, such as databases, artificial intelligence, and web search engines.

- In this project, my primary focus revolves on crafting functions designed to search out values through diverse search algorithms. A key aspect of this project involves delving into the time complexities associated with these algorithms, specifically examining their performance metrics in the worst, average, and best-case scenarios.

Examples
------------------------------

Some basic search algorithms include:

1. Linear Search:
	> Iterates through each item in a collection until the desired item is found.<br>
	> Time complexity: O(n) in the worst case.

2. Binary Search:
	> Applicable only to sorted collections.<br>
	> Divides the search space in half at each step.<br>
	> Time complexity: O(log n) in the worst case.

and more will be looked upto on this project.

More Info

The files containing Big O notation are writen in this format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- 0(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- ...
